# Horses

Understanding your horses is fundamental to success in Track King.

## Horse Traits

### Spirit (Temperament)
Different temperaments influence horse behavior during racing and their rapport with jockeys.

### Height
Measured in hands high (hh), ranging from 15.0hh to 19.2hh. Height affects suitability for different race distances.

### Stride  
The ground covered with each step. Affected by training and influences race performance.

### Medical Condition
- **Vigorous**: Perfect health
- **Other levels**: Indicate injury or high injury risk

### Physical Condition
Affected by racing and training. Recovery comes primarily with time, though vet services help slightly.

### Racing Style
Some horses have special racing styles with unique advantages and drawbacks. Styled horses are valuable!

## Body Stats

### "Top" Stats (Speed)
- **Gate Speed**: Breaking from starting stalls and pace changes
- **Acceleration**: Maximum speed capability

### "Bottom" Stats (Endurance)  
- **Muscle Tone**: Maintaining speed and stamina (arguably most important)
- **Stamina**: Ability to "stay" the race distance
- **Heart**: The mysterious quality that makes horses dig deeper

## Experience (XP) Stats

Help determine optimal racing conditions:

## Key Interface Elements

*The horse management interface shows traits on the left, body stats on the right, and includes an OC-only graph visualization of horse statistics.*

## Training Considerations

- Young horses (2-3 years): Need more training hours
- Older horses (5+ years): Require less intensive training  
- Balance all stats - even sprinters need some stamina
- Monitor condition carefully during training cycles

# Breeding

Creating the next generation of champions.

## Breeding Fundamentals

### What Affects Foals
- ‚úÖ **Parent stats, height, temperament, style**
- ‚úÖ **Genetics and dominance traits**  
- ‚ùå **Horse XP does NOT impact foals**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medical/Physical condition** - opinions vary

### Condition Theories
- Some believe mare must be vig/vig
- Others believe stallion must be vig/vig  
- Some say neither matters
- **Recommended**: Both horses in best possible condition

## The Breeding Process

### Eligibility
- **Horses must be 4+ years old**
- **Mares cannot race while pregnant**
- **Both parents experience condition drop**
- **Gestation period**: 3-4 weeks

### Birth and Development
- **Foals born on Fridays**
- **Start at 2 years old** - race-ready immediately
- **Belong to mare owner** at time of birth
- **"Homebred" status** if you organized the breeding

## Genetics and Dominance

### Styled Horses
- **Dominant stallions**: Consistently pass their style
- **Dominant mares**: Override stallion's style
- **Submissive mares**: Accept stallion's style (preferred)
- **Double dominance**: Unpredictable results

### Breeding Strategy
- **Research breeding history** of both parents
- **Target submissive mares** with styled stallions
- **Week 1 foals** give maximum training time
- **Consider market alternatives** vs. breeding costs

## The Real Costs of Breeding
*Contributed by Cerberus of The Dog Food Factory*

### Class 1 Stable Example (5 weeks total)
- **Stall and vet costs**: $107,440 (minimum 1 hr vets)
- **Missed race purses**: $60,000+ (2 races minimum)
- **Total investment**: $167,440+
- **Additional costs**: If racing weekly, add $180,000

### Mare Care Requirements
- **Must be vig/vig for conception** - no exceptions
- **Recovery time critical** - affects foal development
- **Foal growth tied to mare condition**
- **First week most important** for foal development

## Financial Reality Check

### Cost vs. Benefit Analysis
- **Unstyled foals**: Often available at auction for $20,000
- **Breeding investment**: $167,440+ minimum
- **Market alternatives**: Quality horses often cheaper
- **Success not guaranteed** - even perfect breeding can fail

### When to Breed
- **Week 1 foals preferred** - maximum training time
- **Plan timing carefully** - check season calendar
- **Consider your finances** - can you afford the full cost?
- **Evaluate alternatives** - auction market often has bargains

## Post-Birth Care

### Immediate Needs
- **Vet hours for mare** - birth is exhausting
- **Vet hours for foal** - tired after birth
- **Stall space required** - ensure availability
- **Training planning** - start development immediately

*Remember: Breeding is expensive and risky. Consider whether you can achieve your goals more affordably through the auction market.*

# Class League Racing

As you will have noticed, there are several different types of racing on TK. As a new stable, you need to concentrate on your league races to begin with. Stakes, Cups and Invitationals will come along all in good time, but league is where you need to start!

## Important Facts About League Racing

- **No entry fee, no travel costs** - You're guaranteed a return (number of jockeys bonus)
- **Competitive horses** - Your start-up horses have been given high XP to compensate for their lack of skill stats
- **Restricted competition** - Only you and other stables at your track in your class can enter
- **Points system** - You are awarded points for every race you run in, depending on where you finish

## League Points and Rewards

Points are totalled up over the season, and the top 5 stables receive:
- **Bonus overall place money**
- **Option to promote to a higher league**
- **C1-C3 Leagues** of 8 or more human opponents receive a bonus in Week 0 of between $32,000 and $900,000

## Getting Started Tips

### First Few Weeks
- **Train your horses** - With a few weeks training, they should be reasonably competitive
- **Enter every week** - Consistency is key to earning points
- **Learn from results** - Pay attention to what works and what doesn't

### Race Strategy
- **Study the competition** - Learn about other stables in your league
- **Match horses to distances** - Some horses prefer shorter or longer races
- **Don't expect instant success** - Building a competitive stable takes time

## Why League Racing Matters

**These races are your bread and butter races. It is vital that you enter them each week!**

League racing provides:
- **Steady income** - Regular prize money and bonuses
- **Experience** - Learn the basics of race strategy
- **Foundation** - Build your stable's reputation and skills
- **Progression** - Pathway to higher leagues and better competition

*Master league racing before moving on to the bigger, more expensive race types!*

# Auctions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Beware the Auctions!

**Beware the auctions, for they are an addictive place!**

In your first weeks, you will notice you have a large amount of money, and will be very tempted to buy horses on the auction market with it!

## **DON'T!**

Until you are aware of what constitutes a good or bad horse, and until you are sure what you specifically are looking for in a horse, **DON'T BUY ONE!**

## Market Timing and Strategy

It is important to remember when buying that different times of the season have different popularity:

- **End of season** - Prices may go up as people have received their end of season bonus money
- **Beginning of season** - You will find a lot of cheap, week 1 foals flooding the market

### Research Before Buying

- **Monitor the markets** for a week or so before you start looking for a horse to buy
- **Get an idea** of what is available, and how much it is selling for
- **Ask for advice** - If you are unsure of whether a horse is good value, post a link in the **Help me Please forum**

## Key Rules

### The Most Important Rule
**DO NOT over extend yourself to purchase a horse.**

### Auction Basics
Other than that, there isn't a whole lot to say about auctions - once you have found a horse you like, watch it, bid on it, and hopefully you will get it.

## Important Notes

- ‚ùó **Horses can still be raced** by the current owner while being auctioned!
- üè† **Remember - your new horse will require a STALL** once it is purchased. If you do not have enough stalls available, all your horses will suffer

## Smart Auction Strategy

### Before You Bid
- **Study the horse thoroughly** - Stats, age, training history
- **Check similar horses** - Compare prices and value
- **Set a budget** - And stick to it!
- **Consider total costs** - Stall fees, training, veterinary care

### During Bidding
- **Don't get emotional** - Stick to your research
- **Watch timing** - Many auctions end at specific times
- **Have backup options** - Don't fixate on one horse

*Remember: The auction market can wait. Focus on training your current horses first!*

# First Things Second

As you should have discovered by now, there is a lot in TK. The site contains a lot of information on how best to succeed.

A few basic easy steps to getting started, and getting those horses heading towards winning condition!

## Your First Three Steps

1. **Purchase 2 additional hours of vets** (total 4), apply one hour to each horse
2. **Purchase 8 additional hours of training** (total 12), and apply three to each horse
3. **Enter two horses into class racing** to start earning money and experience

These are the first few important steps to take, and will get you started on your way to success.

## All New Stables Start With

- ‚úÖ **5 stalls** - Room for your starting horses
- ‚úÖ **2 vet hours** - Basic medical care 
- ‚úÖ **4 training hours** - Foundation training time
- ‚úÖ **$250,000+ stable cash** - Depends on class/sponsor money
- ‚úÖ **$50,000+ personal cash** - Your starting funds

## Important Reminders

‚ö†Ô∏è **Without vets, your horses will quickly drop to 'fresh' medical condition!**

üìù **Note:** Horses may be entered into a race or two, depending on what the bots had done this week. Any of these races will have an unlisted apprentice on them.

## What to Focus On

- **Immediate priorities** - Vet hours and training expansion
- **Short-term goals** - Enter class racing to start earning
- **Long-term vision** - Build a sustainable, profitable stable

*Take it one step at a time - you'll be a successful stable manager before you know it!*
# Vet Services

## Overview

Vet services are applied to horses to help increase the rate of improvement in both their physical and medical condition. The more vet hours, the faster you can expect your horses to improve.

**But remember, vets have MINIMAL impact on physical recuperation. Time plays a much more important role than vets.**

## When Vet Services Are Needed

Racing and some types of training are hard work on your horse, and you can expect a drop in physical condition, and if the horse picks up an injury in a race, a drop in medical condition. This is when your team of expert vets step in, and work hard to get the horse fit and healthy again.

Some training types (pampering) will also help improve your horses physical and medical condition, but remember, every training has its drawbacks!

## Key Facts About Vet Services

### Vet Hours Limit
- **Maximum 12 hours** per horse per week (same as training)
- **Weekly billing** - You pay the cost each week regardless of use
- **No reduction costs** - Unlike other services, reducing vet hours has no cost

### Effectiveness
- ‚úÖ **Helpful for recovery** - Speeds up condition improvement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Time is more important** - Natural recovery is the primary factor
- üè• **Injury focus** - Most effective for medical condition issues

## Cost Management

### Class-Based Pricing
- Depending on your class, vet hours will cost different amounts
- Higher classes pay more for the same services
- Budget accordingly when planning your stable expenses

### Timing Reductions
**Important:** If you wish to reduce your number of vet hours, the best time to do it is as close as possible to financial update on Sunday night. This maximizes the amount of time you get from the vets that you have already paid for, without incurring the cost of having them on staff for another week.

## Strategic Use

### When to Use More Vet Hours
- **After tough races** - Help horses recover faster
- **During injury periods** - Speed medical condition improvement
- **Heavy training periods** - Support physical condition maintenance

### When to Reduce Vet Hours
- **Healthy stable** - When all horses are in good condition
- **Budget constraints** - Cut costs during tight financial periods
- **Off-season** - When horses aren't racing or training heavily

*Use vet services wisely - they help, but time heals best!*

Racing and some types of training are hard work on your horse, and you can expect a drop in physical condition, and if the horse picks up an injury in a race, a drop in medical condition. This is when your team of expert vets step in, and work hard to get the horse fit and healthy again.

Some training types (pampering) will also help improve your horses physical and medical condition, but remember, every training has its drawbacks!

### Vet Hours Limit
- **Maximum 12 hours** per horse per week (same as training)
- **Weekly billing** - You pay the cost each week regardless of use
- **No reduction costs** - Unlike other services, reducing vet hours has no cost

### Effectiveness
- ‚úÖ **Helpful for recovery** - Speeds up condition improvement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Time is more important** - Natural recovery is the primary factor
- üè• **Injury focus** - Most effective for medical condition issues

## Cost Management

### Class-Based Pricing
- Depending on your class, vet hours will cost different amounts
- Higher classes pay more for the same services
- Budget accordingly when planning your stable expenses

### Timing Reductions
**Important:** If you wish to reduce your number of vet hours, the best time to do it is as close as possible to financial update on Sunday night. This maximizes the amount of time you get from the vets that you have already paid for, without incurring the cost of having them on staff for another week.

## Strategic Use

### When to Use More Vet Hours
- **After tough races** - Help horses recover faster
- **During injury periods** - Speed medical condition improvement
- **Heavy training periods** - Support physical condition maintenance

### When to Reduce Vet Hours
- **Healthy stable** - When all horses are in good condition
- **Budget constraints** - Cut costs during tight financial periods
- **Off-season** - When horses aren't racing or training heavily

*Use vet services wisely - they help, but time heals best!*

## Your First Three Steps

1. **Purchase 2 additional hours of vets** (total 4), apply one hour to each horse
2. **Purchase 8 additional hours of training** (total 12), and apply three to each horse
3. **Enter two horses into class racing** to start earning money and experience

These are the first few important steps to take, and will get you started on your way to success.

## What Every New Stable Starts With

- üè† **5 stalls** - Room for your horses
- üè• **2 vet hours** - Basic medical care
- üí™ **4 training hours** - Basic training capacity
- üí∞ **$250,000+ stable cash** (depends on Class/sponsor money)
- üíµ **$50,000+ personal cash** - Your spending money
- üêé **Horses all at vig/vig** - Ready to race condition

## Important First Week Notes

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical:** Without vets, your horses will quickly drop to 'fresh' medical condition!

**üìù Note:** Your horses may already be entered into a race or two, depending on what the bots had done this week. Any of these races will have an unlisted apprentice jockey on them.

## Priority Checklist

### Week 1 Priorities
- ‚úÖ **Set up veterinary care** - Get those vet hours allocated
- ‚úÖ **Plan training schedule** - Decide which horses need what training
- ‚úÖ **Enter league races** - Start earning money and points
- ‚úÖ **Explore the interface** - Get familiar with the game layout

### What Can Wait
- ‚ùå **Buying new horses** - Focus on your current stable first
- ‚ùå **Complex training plans** - Start simple
- ‚ùå **Stakes racing** - League racing first
- ‚ùå **Breeding** - Much too early for this

## Getting Help

If you're feeling overwhelmed, remember:
- **Ask questions** in the Help Me Please forum
- **Follow Charlie's tour** - Your virtual guide
- **Read this helpfile** - Everything you need is here
- **Start slowly** - Don't try to do everything at once

*Take it one step at a time - you'll be a successful stable manager before you know it!*

# Stakes Racing

Stakes Racing occurs on a Monday and a Friday. Races open to the public 3 days prior to running. If you have received an invite, you can enter anytime you like.

If you receive an invite to a race, be sure that the race suits your horses and your training plan. You DO NOT have to accept race invitations.

Each Local Track will have 4 or more stakes races created every Monday and Friday. You can travel to other tracks, and other continents to find a race that really suits your horses. You don't have to stay at your local track. So look around, find somewhere that might have empty/easier races.

Each week, over 1000 stakes races are created worldwide.

## Racing Restrictions

Stakes races come with various restrictions to create fair competition:

### Common Restrictions
- **Class restrictions** - Bot stables create Class 1-3 and Class 4-6 races
- **Age restrictions** - Horse of a certain age or age bracket are eligible
- **Gender restriction** - Some races for specific gender only
- **Earnings restriction** - Based on total prize money won (e.g., less than $0.5million)
- **Overall ratings restriction** - Horses under a certain vig/vig rating
- **Limited by number of wins** - More or less than specified wins
- **Maiden** - Only horses who have never won a race
- **Debutantes** - Horses making their track debut
- **Birth restricted** - Horses born within a certain period
- **Apprentice riders only** - Only apprentice jockeys allowed
- **Continent restricted** - Only horses from specific continents
- **Track restricted** - Only horses from local track stables
- **Owner/breeder restricted** - Horse must be homebred
- **Prestige restricted** - Limited to certain stable prestige levels

## The Cost

Stakes racing has financial implications you must consider:

- **Entry fees** - Most stakes races charge entry fees (small number of free-entry stakes exist)
- **Travel costs** - Factor in horse travel and jockey travel expenses
- **Risk vs reward** - Try to cover your costs with a 5th place purse
- **Field size matters** - If less than five horses enter, you only receive the purse for your actual finishing position

## The Advantages

- üèÜ **Gain prestige** for racing away from your home track
- üéØ **Create races** (OC members only) for additional prestige
- üåç **More variety** in race types and competition levels
- üí∞ **Higher purses** than league racing

## The Disadvantages

- üí∏ **Costs money** without guaranteed returns like league racing
- ‚úàÔ∏è **Travel affects schedules** - can disrupt training and vet schedules  
- üèá **Open competition** - could face several Class 1 top-level horses

## Race Selection Strategy

Recent changes to bot stables have made higher-class bots more competitive, with 60+ rated horses now common in open stakes. This makes race selection crucial for new stables.

### Smart Selection Guidelines

**Look for these race types:**
- **C4-6 restricted** - More likely to have similar-level competition
- **Overall rating restricted** - Better chance with horses close to the rating limit
- **Prestige restricted** - Prevents high-prestige stables from dominating

### Before Entering
- **CHECK RATINGS** - Look at other entrants' ratings vs your horses
- **Use search functions** - OC race search makes finding suitable races easier
- **Calculate costs** - Ensure you can cover expenses with realistic finishing position
- **Match restrictions** - Find races that suit your horses' strengths

*Stakes racing is the next step up from league racing - choose your battles wisely!*

# Betting

Betting is available for anyone on TK, in any race. The beginning of season six saw the introduction of automatic race pools in any race where a human owned stable entered a horse. This was implemented to encourage players to bet more frequently, and to increase the chance of getting money back on a modest bet.

Betting is a great way to supplement your personal finance income, which can then be used for other features, such as the training track or HOOF race simulator.

If you're new, and just starting out, you might not have much of an idea which horses or races to bet on. It is well worth checking out the **Punters Paradise Forum**, where more experienced players post big races that have big betting pools.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

Remember, while successful bets **increase** your stable prestige, bad bets **decrease** it. That might not seem like a big deal, but remember, your stable prestige is closely linked to the amount of sponsorship your stable receives each week. So be careful when betting!

## Bet Types

When you place a bet, you may bet on several different outcomes:

### Simple Bets
- **Win** ü•á - Wagering on a horse being outright winner, only pays 1st place
- **Place** üéØ - A bet on the horse to finish 1st, 2nd or 3rd. Usually pays at a lower rate than the win odds but more likely to pay out

### Combination Bets  
- **Exacta** üé≤ - Picking the first and second placed horses, in exactly the right order
- **Trifecta** üèÜ - Picking the 1st place horse, followed by 2nd and 3rd in either order (2 combinations in total, so twice the price)

## Betting Restrictions

As we've all got access to a little insider information in Track King (after all, we are the Stable owners, right?!), there are a few restrictions placed on betting:

### Field Size Requirements
- **To bet on a win:** Field must contain at least **3 horses**, with 0 or 3-or-more named jockeys
- **To bet on a place:** Field must contain at least **5 horses**, with 0 or 5-or-more named jockeys  
- **To bet on an exacta:** Same as a place bet requirements
- **To bet on a trifecta:** Field must contain at least **7 horses**, with 0 or 5-or-more named jockeys

## Smart Betting Strategy

### For Beginners
- **Start small** - Don't risk large amounts while learning
- **Study form** - Look at horse stats and recent performance
- **Follow the experts** - Check Punters Paradise Forum for tips
- **Focus on place bets** - More likely to pay out than win bets

### Advanced Tips
- **Watch for value** - Sometimes good horses have surprisingly high odds
- **Consider field size** - Smaller fields = better chances but lower payouts
- **Track prestige impact** - Remember betting affects your stable's reputation
- **Personal finance** - Use winnings for training track and HOOF features

## Community Resources

- **Punters Paradise Forum** - Expert tips and race analysis
- **Racing results feed** - Track historical performance data
- **Big race notifications** - Follow experienced punters' recommendations

*Bet responsibly - it's meant to be fun and supplement your income, not replace it!*

# GM & Bug Reports

## Bug Reports

When you access the report a bug link on the Home/Help/Forum pages, it takes you to a page like that used when creating a new forum posting. The information you type then gets posted to a private "Bug Report" forum, that all admin staff can access.

If the MODs/GMs can answer the question, they will do so via TK Mail. They will give you details on what the problem is, and how you can get around it. Or, if it actually is a Bug, with information on what will be done to fix it.

### Remember
If you aren't sure if it is a Bug, raise the question in the **Help me please?!** forum first. People will tell you pretty quickly if they know a workaround, or they will tell you to raise it as a bug. The MODs also look at this forum, and will often answer the question/problem and answer it in the forum.

This makes it quicker and easier for the Administration from getting inundated with 'false reports' which makes it faster and easier for the admin to answer and fix actual Bugs.

Remembering when reporting to include as much information on what the suspected bug is, and what happened and what you were trying to do at the time.

## GM Reports

As with the Bug Reports, GM reports are posted to a private admin forum where all admin staff can view them.

GM reports are to be used to report a **problem**, **offensive behaviour**, or a **cheat**.

### When Reporting Issues

When reporting information such as offensive forum behaviour remember to include:
- **The forum name**
- **The thread name**  
- **A copy of the offensive comment**
- **What you find offensive about it**

This enables the MODs to find the appropriate post and quickly and effectively respond to the complaint.

The same applies with cheats and problems. When reporting, remember to put as much detail into the reports to make it easier for the MODs and admin staff to act quickly and efficiently.

*Use these reporting tools responsibly - they help maintain the Track King community for everyone.*

# Prestige

## What is Prestige?

Prestige equates to your stable's overall 'score' in Track King, an indicator of the success you've had as a stable manager and sometimes gambler! 

## Benefits of Prestige

Prestige can:
- **Make your facilities more attractive** for public lease
- **Open doorways into higher stake** (and purse!) Cup racing
- **Help persuade better jockeys** to sign with your stable

## How to Gain Prestige

You can gain prestige to a greater or lesser extent by:

- **Winning races**
- **Placing in races**
- **Promoting to next racing class** (or lose prestige by demoting!)
- **Participating/winning races away from your Local Track**
- **Being a successful gambler**

## Types of Prestige

Prestige comes in several forms on TK. Primarily, the prestige refers to the level your stable is at. 

## Important Effects

- **Prestige is responsible for sponsors deciding how much money to give you**
- **It affects what jockeys will ride for you**

*Prestige reflects your stable's success and reputation in the Track King community - build it through consistent performance and smart management.*

# Training Track

The Training Track is yet another exciting feature of Track King. This facility is paid for with Personal Finance and is available to anyone who wishes to use it.

## Important Safety Note

Once you click to start a training session, the money is automatically deducted from your bank account. If you do not complete the session, you will lose the money, and won't get the potential XP gains.

## The Three Session Types

### Session 1: The Light Session (Arcade Mile)
An arcade style game where you compete against nine other bot horses. You can select the jockey type and race level:

- **Easy** - the jockey maintains perfect balance throughout the race
- **Medium** - the jockey may lose balance during the race  
- **Hard** - the jockey may lose balance, and scramble the directions

*This is NOT a training session - no physical/medical impact, or XP gain*
**Cost: $1,000**

### Session 2: Normal Session
A regular training session where you can select distance, weather, track type, number of opponents, quality of horses, jockey, and race instructions.

A small medical/physical loss can be expected, plus experience in the selected distance/track condition.
**Cost: $20,000**

### Session 3: Full Session
This is equivalent to a normal race. Expect the same physical/medical loss and experience gains as a regular race.
**Cost: $50,000**

*The Training Track offers a controlled environment to test your horses and strategies.*

*Understanding these levels helps you make better decisions about training, racing, and horse management.*

## Your First Three Steps

1. **Purchase 2 additional hours of vets** (total 4), apply one hour to each horse
2. **Purchase 8 additional hours of training** (total 12), and apply three to each horse
3. **Enter two horses into class racing** to start earning money and experience

These are the first few important steps to take, and will get you started on your way to success.

## What Every New Stable Starts With

- üè† **5 stalls** - Room for your horses
- üè• **2 vet hours** - Basic medical care
- üí™ **4 training hours** - Basic training capacity
- üí∞ **$250,000+ stable cash** (depends on Class/sponsor money)
- üíµ **$50,000+ personal cash** - Your spending money
- üêé **Horses all at vig/vig** - Ready to race condition

## Important First Week Notes

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical:** Without vets, your horses will quickly drop to 'fresh' medical condition!

**üìù Note:** Your horses may already be entered into a race or two, depending on what the bots had done this week.

## Priority Checklist

### Week 1 Priorities
- ‚úÖ **Set up veterinary care** - Get those vet hours allocated
- ‚úÖ **Plan training schedule** - Decide which horses need what training
- ‚úÖ **Enter league races** - Start earning money and points
- ‚úÖ **Explore the interface** - Get familiar with the game layout

*Take it one step at a time - you'll be a successful stable manager before you know it!*

# Injury Profile

The Injury Profile system helps you understand and manage injury risks for your horses.

## Understanding Injury Risk

Each horse has different susceptibility to injuries based on:
- **Age** - Older horses may be more prone to certain injuries
- **Training intensity** - Heavy training increases injury risk
- **Racing frequency** - More races can mean higher injury chance
- **Medical condition** - Current health affects future injury risk

## Using the Injury Profile

### Training Decisions
- **Adjusting training intensity** based on injury risk
- **Scheduling rest periods** for high-risk horses
- **Balancing development with safety**

### Racing Strategy
- **Choosing appropriate races** for each horse's risk level
- **Timing race entries** to minimize injury exposure

## Prevention Strategies

- **Monitor medical condition** closely
- **Use appropriate vet hours** for injury-prone horses
- **Balance training types** to avoid overuse injuries
- **Schedule recovery time** between intensive periods

*Use the Injury Profile to balance performance goals with horse welfare.*

# Agistment, Facilities and Money!

## Agistment

This is the term given to extra stalls that you buy, and with the help of your handy admin staff, they are leased out to the public. Each stable is allowed a maximum of 30 stalls. The number of these stalls that you can afford to buy and lease is entirely up to you. It is a good source of reliable steady income to add to that sponsorship!

Training hours can also be purchased (max. 60) and leased to the public in the same manner.

**Admin Staff** - once hired these staff do require a small weekly wage, but it is a very small percentage of the amount of income they bring into your stable.

## Facilities

On the training & vet page, you will also notice a Specialist Facilities section. There are many different types of facilities, and each one has a different bonus it adds to the stable. The prices vary, and the amount of money you put into them varies. Which facilities you choose depends entirely on you, and what you want.

### An Important Note

These facilities are **OPTIONAL** only. You can still run a very successful stable without them. It is also important to not underestimate the amount these facilities will take from your weekly cashflow. If you are only just breaking even - they are probably NOT a good idea.

## The Money Side

- **Facilities** - cost money  
- **Agistment** - provides money

The key is balancing investments in facilities with the reliable income from agistment services. Plan your finances carefully and ensure you can afford the ongoing costs before committing to major facility purchases.

*Smart facility and agistment management can significantly boost your stable's financial health and competitive capabilities.*
