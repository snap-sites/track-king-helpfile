# Jockeys

Jockeys are tricky little blighters, and no one knows the exact formula to success with a jockey just yet, but here is a few ideas to help you get started on finding, hiring, training or hoping for, a great jockey!

## The types of jockeys:

- **Apprentice/unlisted** - this is the lowest of low on the jockey hierachy, and can be hired for a small fee (class dependant) and is simply selected when you are entering a race.

- **Stable Apprentice** - the middle ground, this jockey is hired and trained by your stable, but it is important to remember that he isnt as good as the real deal. He is still learning!

- **Professional Jockey** - this is the real deal! These guys know their stuff, they have been there and done it. BUT that does NOT mean they will make your horse win! These jockeys are hired on short term contracts, and will serve your stable until the end contract date.

## Jockey Stats:

- Weight - 50-65kg
- Age - 19-32 years old  
- Personality - Aggressive tendencies or passive tendencies
  - Aggressive - Aggressive, Fires up early/very early, fires up late/very late
  - Passive - Passive, calm, tends to ease late/very late
- You can only hire a jockey who is in your current class***

## Professional Jockeys

One of the best advantages you can give yourself when starting out, is to hire a professional jockey. For approximately $10k/week a class 4 stable of dire prestige can hire a reasonable professional jockey. This jockey will help give you an edge over the other horses, and improve your race results.

These jockeys are hired via the 'Hire a Jockey' link on your stable page, for a short term contract, for varying amounts of money. The wages and contract length depend on the jockeys prestige, and also the prestige of your stable, and the difference between the two. A low prestige stable, hiring a higher prestige jockey can expect to pay more per week, and have a shorter contract period.

### When hiring a jockey:

**Enter your search criteria:**
- **Weight** - remember a heavy jockey is not good on a light horse, so aim for a jockey to suit your lightest horse
- **Wage** - restrict the wage to what you can reasonably afford each week
- **Contract Status** - At this point, you are after an uncontracted jockey
- **Skills:**
  - **Prestige** - aim to get a jockey as close in prestige to you as possible. You will get a better price, better contract, and the jockey will perform better for you the closer it is in prestige to you
  - **Experience** - If most of your horses are sprinters (as start-up horses tend to be) then aim for a jockey with moderate or higher sprint xp
- **Passive or Aggressive tendencies** - If you have alot of high spirited horses, you may want to consider a calmer jockey
- **Remember** - the more search criteria you put in, the less jockey options you will get

**Consider each jockey in the search results, and consider the following important aspects:**
- **Ability to work with difficult horses** - the better this is, the better the jockey will work with your horses
- **Traits:** Some traits will conflict with other traits, and may cause the jockey to become confused, so consider each one carefully.

**Haggle** - Generally, a jockey will haggle once with you, and offer a reduction in the wage initially offered - the amount varies. Should the jockey refuse to negotiate further, don't panic, just remember the name, and you can negotiate with them again in 24 hours. Occasionally a jockey will let you haggle twice (usually if you prestige is significantly higher than their prestige) but generally won't happen while you have low stable prestige. When you are haggling, remember to watch the jockeys' negotiation morale - the lower it is, the more likely the jockey will refuse to haggle.

**Contract Period** - While the jockey is contracted to your stable, you can use them for any races (excepting apprentice only races). If you don't use them, you still have to pay the wages!

**Morale** - The better your jockey morale, the better they perform. When first contracted, your jockey's morale will be around satisfactory usually, and it will improve with successful racing, and drop with bad races.

**Holidays** - once your contract with a jockey finishes, they go on holidays. In your stable diary, they will give you an approximate return time and date in case you wish to re-hire them. The better they performed, more they earnt, and higher their morale when they leave your stable, the closer to the expected return time they will return.

## Stable Apprentice

A good option for any stable, as they are inexpensive and can be trained by you, the hiring stable, and be customised to suit your needs and your horses. The jockey will build experience as he races, and improve right along with you.

An apprentice jockey serves a minimum apprenticeship of one season (3 calendar months) up to four seasons (one calendar year). Once the apprentice jockey is released, and becomes a professional jockey, you the training stable recieve a small amount of income off every contract the jockey retains, percentage based on jockey earnings. You are also able to hire the jockey, regardless of class once released.

When you do release your jockey into the big wide world to become a professional, he will be released into the class that your stable was in when you first hired him, unless you choose a different class.

Each week, your stable apprentice will earn a minimum of 5 training points, which you can apply to the various traits or experiences, to suit your needs. If you are unsure of where to start - apply credits to your horses 'ability to work with difficult horses' as this is a very important trait. Credits are also earnt through good performance in races, and also through the use of certain specialist facilities.

### A few important things to look for when hiring a stable apprentice from the Jockey Recruitment Agency:

- **Age** - get the youngest possible apprentice, so you can get as many seasons as possible prior to their retirement at 32 years old.
- **Weight** - aim for a lower weight jockey, as heavier jockeys are poorly matched with light horses
- **Personality** - Consider which personality trait you would consider to be the most appropriate for your needs, and your future plans for the jockey
- All other traits and experience are trained/developed while with your stable. As such, you do not need to take into consideration these factors when hiring.
- Don't be afraid to reject the applicants the first or even second time around if they don't suit what you are looking for.

## A few ups and downs of the jockey game

- while less experienced, an apprentice jockey will not get the most out of your horse, and will be less likely to win a tough race.
- a professional jockey is much better at riding the horse, and getting the most out of them. But remember the down side - your horse is far more likely to come out of the race in worse physical shape!

And remember, there is no exact formula, and no right answer. The perfect jockey will not mean the perfect race. A poor jockey will not mean you lose the race.

***An apprentice jockey trained by your stable is the exception, with you being able to hire them regardless of your class or theirs. This initiative was bought in to serve as a small bonus to stables who take the initiative to train an apprentice, and as partial compensation for possible reduced winnings during the training period.
