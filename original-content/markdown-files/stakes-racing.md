# Stakes Racing

Stakes Racing occurs on a Monday and a Friday. Races open to the public 3 days prior to running. If you have recieved an invite, you can enter anytime you like.

If you recieve an invite to a race, be sure that they race suits your horses, and your training plan. You DO NOT have to accept race invitations.

Each Local Track will have 4 or more stakes races created every monday and friday. You can travel to other tracks, and other continents to find a race that really suits your horses. You don't have to stay at your local track. So look around, find somewhere that might have empty/easier races.

Each week, over 1000 stakes races are created world wide.

## Racing Restrictions

A few racing restrictions you will notice:

- **Class restrictions** - Bot stables create a Class 1-3 and a Class 4-6 race at each local track monday and friday.
- **Age Restrictions** - Horse of a certain age or age bracket are only eligible to race.
- **Gender restriction** - Some races will be for a specific gender
- **Earnings Restriction** - A restriction on how much the horse has earnt overall in assessing it's eligibility to enter eg. Less than $0.5million
- **Overall Ratings Restriction** - Restrictions for horses to be under a certain vig/vig overall rating
- **Limited by number of wins** - Horses with either more or less of the specified number of wins are eligible
- **Maiden** - Only horses who have never won a race before may enter
- **Debutantes** - Horses who are making their track debut and have never raced before.
- **Birth Restricted** - Races for horses born within a certain period prior to the race

- **Owner/Breeder Restricted** - The horse must have been bred by the stable entering (Invitational race option only)
- **Prestige Restricted** - Races that are limited to entrants of a certain stable prestige.

**Important fact to remember** - if you enter races with large purses - $50k+ then remember there will be more competition, and most likely better rated horses. Stay within the boundaries of what your horses can be competitive at.

## The Cost

- Stakes racing has an entry fee - there is a small number of random free-entry stakes.
- Be sure to factor in all costs when planning which race to enter - horse travel, jockey travel & entry fee's.
- Look at how much all the place winners recieve when you are picking - try to cover your costs with a 5th place purse.
- If less than five horses enter, you only recieve the purse for the place that you get (eg. if three horses enter, and 2nd/3rd is worth $10k, and you come third, you only recieve $10k)

## The Advantages

- You gain prestige for racing away from your home track
- You gain prestige for creating races (OC members only)
- You get more variety in race types and in the competition.

## The Disadvantages

- The races cost money without the guaranteed return.
- Travelling away from home can affect both training and vet schedules
- The races CAN be open to all levels of horses - you could end up with several class one top level horses in your race


## Race Selection

Several seasons ago, some changes were made to the bot stables throughout TK. The ratings on bot stables in higher classes were increased to make the higher leagues more competitive even when there is not as many active players.

This has had a significant impact in open stakes races as well, where it is now not uncommon to see a 60+ rated horse from a bot stable. This has had a big impact on lower class new stables, and it has made selection of the right race even more important.

When you are picking your race it's important to follow a few simple guides:

- **C4-6 restricted** - these races will be more likely to have competition (both bot and owned stable) that is of a similiar level to your new stable
- **Overall Rating restricted** - these races may or may not be open to all classes, but even if they are, you have a better chance of doing well in them with horses that fall close to the overall rating of the restriction.
- **Prestige restricted** - these races may or may not be open to all classes, but it stops big, high prestige stables from jumping in.
- **LOOK!** - Check what the rating is of the other entrants, and make sure that they aren't higher than your horses. Not all open stakes races have 60+ rated races. It is worth looking around, and this is where the race search function from OC comes into it's own, as it makes it significantly easier to find suitable races.
