# Forums

## Overview

The forums are a hive of activity! It is the place you can come to discuss training, racing, wins, losses or just about anything else!

## Automatic Subscriptions

When you register for your stable, you will automatically be subscribed to the following forums:

### Geographic Forums
- **Global** - where everyone comes to play
- **Continent** - Stables from your continent
- **Regional** - The place where most big races (Cups & stakes) will be run
- **Local** - Your local track forum, a great way to keep in touch with other TK's at your track, and to discuss upcoming events

### Help and Community Forums
- **Help Me Please** - this is the place for you! Everyone contributes to answering any questions you may have (check the help pages first, the answer may be there!)
- **Suggestions & Ideas** - Everyone is free to make suggestions about changes and improvements to the game. Hairboy & Fishbrain check it quite regularly, and a lot of the ideas have been implemented from these forums. You may want to wait until you have a little more knowledge of the game before you go making suggestions though!

### Trading and Racing Forums
- **Horse Ads** - The place to advertise and view horses/studs that other stables are selling (not every horse on the auction market will be there)
- **Racing Ads** - A great place to find races that have been set up by your fellow TKers, and to request invites for them as well!
- **Punters Paradise** - So you're new, you have this personal money, and you want to bet! This is the place to go to see who is the who in a race!
- **Track Bulletins** - This is where you will find notices of changes to the game being made

## Forum Rules

The forums have a few basic rules that must be adhered to, for respect to the other players, and for harmony within our community:

- **The main forums are ENGLISH speaking only**
- **No offensive language (swearing)**
- **No verbal attacks on other players**
- **Remember to keep posts in the appropriate forums** - Racing/horse Ads in those forums etc etc - The MODs will move inappropriate posts

## Reporting Issues

If you are offended by something you have read or had done to you in the forums, **DO NOT take it up with the guilty party**. Use the [Contact a GM](http://www.trackking.org/forumpost.php?fid=5&act=newt) link to provide the Admin staff with the details of what offended you. Remember to provide them the forum, the thread, and a copy of the actual post is always handy as well.

## Punishment System

**If you do the wrong thing:**

1. **First Offence:** 3 days forum ban, 10% of funds
2. **Second Offence:** 7 days forum ban, 25% of funds
3. **Third Offence:** 3 weeks forum ban, and 50% of funds
4. **Fourth Offence:** Period of time suspension from the game, and monetary fine from stables funds to be determined at the time
5. **Fifth Offence:** Removal from the game

## Important Notes

Remember these steps are for repeat offenders, and you won't immediately be banned and fined for making one tiny error. The MODs and admin are fairly lenient, and should you step out of line slightly, you will probably be sent a friendly reminder. If you make a big error after that, you will probably receive a formal warning. It's only if you fail to learn from these mistakes that the above punishment system will be implemented.

**Just remember to be respectful to the other players in our community, and you won't have any problems!**
