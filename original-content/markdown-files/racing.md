# Class League Racing

As you will have noticed, there is several different types of racing on TK. As new stable, you need to concentrate on your league races to begin with. Stakes, Cups and Invitationals will come along all in good time, but league is where you need to start!

## Important facts about league racing:

- There is no entry fee, no travel costs, and you a guaranteed a return (number of jockeys bonus)
- Your start-up horses have been given high XP to compensate for their lack of skill stats. With a few weeks training, they should be reasonably competitive. (this will depend on how populated your league is)
- The race is restricted so that only you and other stables at your track in your class can enter
- You are awarded points for every race you run in, depending on where you come in the field
  - These points are totalled up over the season, and the top 5 stables recieve bonus overall place money, as well as the option to promote to a higher league
  - C1-C3 Leagues of 8 or more human opponents will receive a bonus in Week 0 of between $32,000 and $900,000

**These races are your bread and butter races. It is vital that you enter them each week!**
