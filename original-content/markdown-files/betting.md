# Betting

Betting is available for anyone on TK, in any race. The beginning of season six saw the introduction of automatic race pools in any race where a human owned stable entered a horse. This was implemented to encourage players to bet more frequently, and the ensure to increase the chance of getting money back on a modest bet.

Betting is a great way to supplement your personal finance income, which can then be used for other features, such as the training track or HOOF race simulator.

If you're new, and just starting out, you might not have much of an idea which horses or races to bet on. It is well worth checking out the Punters Paradise Forum, where more experienced players post big races that have big betting pools.

## WARNING

Remember, while successful bets increase your stable prestige, bad bets decrease it. That might not seem like a big deal, but remember, your stable prestige is closely linked to the amount of sponsorship you stable recieves each week. So be careful when betting!

## Bet Types

When you place a bet, you may bet on several different outcomes:

- **Win** - Wagering on a horse being outright winner, only pays 1st place
- **Place** - A bet on the horse to finish 1st, 2nd or 3rd. Usually pays at a lower rate than the win odds but more likely to pay out.
- **Exacta** - Picking the first and second placed horses, in exactly the right order
- **Trifecta** - Picking the 1st place horse, followed by 2nd and 3rd in either order (2 combinations in total, so twice the price)

## Betting Restrictions

As we've all got access to a little insider information in Track King (after all, we are the Stable owners, right?!), there are a few restrictions placed on betting:

- **To bet on a win:** The field must contain at least 3 horses, with 0 or 3-or-more named jockeys.
- **To bet on a place:** The field must contain at least 5 horses, with 0 or 5-or-more named jockeys.
- **To bet on an exacta:** Same as a place bet
- **To bet on a trifecta:** The field must contain at least 7 horses, with 0 or 5-or-more named jockeys.
