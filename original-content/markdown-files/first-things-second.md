# First Things Second

As you should have discovered by now, there is alot in TK. The site contains alot of information on how best to succeed.

A few basic easy steps to getting started, and getting those horses heading towards winning condition!

1. Purchase 2 additional hours of vets (total 4), apply one hour to each horse
2. Purchase 8 additional hours of training (total 12), and apply three to each horse (see training types)
3. Enter two horses into class racing. (see Class Racing)

These are the first few important steps to take, and will get your started on your way to success.

## All new stables on TK start with:

- 5 stalls
- 2 vet hours  
- 4 training hours
- $250,000+ stable cash (depends on Class/sponsor money)
- $50,000+ personal cash
- Horses all at vig/vig and ready to race.

**It's important to remember, without vets, your horses will quickly drop to 'fresh' medical condition!**

**Note:** Horses may be entered into a race or two, depending on what the bots had done this week. Any of these races will have an unlisted apprentice on them.
