# GM & Bug Reports

## Bug Reports
**Link:** http://www.trackking.org/forumpost.php?fid=2&act=newt

When you access the report a bug link on the Home/Help/Forum pages, it takes you to a page like that used when creating a new forum posting. The information you type then gets posted to a private "Bug Report" forum, that all admin staff can access.

If the MODs/GMs can answer the question, they will do so via TK Mail. They will give you details on what the problem is, and how you can get around it. Or, if it actually is a Bug, with information on what will be done to fix it.

### Remember
If you arent sure if it is a Bug, raise the question in the Help me please?! forum first. People will tell you pretty quickly if they know a workaround, or they will tell you to raise it as a bug. The MODs also look at this forum, and will often answer the question/problem and answer it in the forum.

This makes it quicker and easier for the Administration from getting inundated with 'false reports' which makes it faster and easier for the admin to answer and fix actual Bugs.

Remembering when reporting to include as much information on what the suspected bug is, and what happened and what you were trying to do at the time.

## GM Reports

As with the Bug Reports, GM reports are posted to a private admin forum where all admin staff can view them.

GM reports are to be used to report a **problem**, **offensive behaviour**, or a **cheat**.

When reporting information such as offensive forum behaviour remember to include:
- The forum name
- The thread name  
- A copy of the offensive comment
- What you find offensive about it

This enables the MODs to find the appropriate post and quickly and effectively respond to the complaint.

The same applies with cheats and problems. When reporting, remember to put as much detail into the reports to make it easier for the MODs and admin staff to act quickly and efficiently.
