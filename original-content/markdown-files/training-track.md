# Training Track

The Training Track is yet another exciting feature of Track King. This facility is paid for with Personal Finance. This facility is **NOT** an Owners' Club feature, and is available to anyone who wishes to use it.

It is important to remember, once you click to start a training session, the money is automatically deducted from your bank account. If you do not complete the session, you will lose the money, and won't get the potential XP gains, or the medical/physical loss.

The training track can be used to train younger horses and give them experience at whichever race distance you intend to race them at. It can also be used on older horses to see how they fair outside of their preferred racing distance - eg. just how far can your sprinter run before they tire.

It is always a good way of seeing how well some jockey personalities go with your horses temperament.

## The training track has three different session types:

### Session 1: The Light Session (Arcade Mile)
An arcade style game, you select a horse from you stable, and you compete against nine other bot horses. You can select the jockey type, the race level:
- **Easy** - the jockey maintains perfect balance throughout the race
- **Medium** - the jockey may lose balance during the race  
- **Hard** - the jockey may lose balance, and scramble the directions

If you win the race, your points are tallied, and you have a chance of making the high score table. The high score table will be reset at the beginning of each season. If you make the top three in the high scores, you get a trophy in your trophy cabinet.

*This is NOT a training session - no physical/medical impact, or XP gain*

**Cost: $1000**

### Session 2: Normal Session
A regular training session, you can select the distance, weather, track type, number of opponents, quality of the horses, select a jockey, and set race instructions. Race instructions can be altered during the race, and as with a real race situation, the jockey factors the instructions in, but ultimately makes their own decision about how to run the race.

A small medical/physical loss can be expected from this session, as well as a small amount of experience (in the distance and/or the track condition you selected).

**Cost: $20,000**

### Session 3: Full Session
This is just like a race, only you control all the conditions. As with the normal session, you make all the choices regarding the layout of the race/competition.

This race is the equivalent to a normal race for the horse. Expect the same physical/medical loss as you would from a normal race, and the same experience to be gained. Slightly larger gains/smaller losses for good performances!

**Cost: $50,000**

## A few hints:
- The better condition you horse is in, the better his chance of doing well, and of getting an XP increase.
- As with a real race, you won't necessarily get an XP pop in every session.
- Be careful scheduling training track sessions near racing/training. You don't want to accidentally exhaust your horse right before a big race!
- It can be helpful to keep track of the data produced at the end of the race (Quarterly split times) for future reference - once you leave that page, they are lost.
