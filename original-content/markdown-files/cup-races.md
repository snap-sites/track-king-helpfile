# Cup Races

This is the TK crowning glory. Winning a Cup!

There is many different cups, some are TK sponsored, some are sponsored by business and corporate companies, and other are sponsored by TK players themselves!

You can find out about all the different cups on the [General Cup Info](http://www.trackking.org/cuphome.php) page!

## Official TK Cups
These are cups that are sponsored by TK, and for the regional ones such as Sprint Shield, Magic Mile, Classic/Challenge, you will receive your invite automatically. For other official TK cups such as the Track King Open and the Paupers Kettle, you will have to purchase invites via the Cup Info page if you want to participate.

## Official Sponsored Cups
These are cups that are sponsored by a mixture of companies wishing to advertise in TK, and by TK players themselves! The exception is the Breeders Cup Series, which, while under name is sponsored by this very site, it is now sponsored by a group of dedicated players within TK, for which we are very grateful, as it would be sad to see these cups disappear from the calendar.

## Community Cups
These are cups that can be created by anyone within TK, for the cost of some game credits. They are then created and once they have reached their required number of credits, they are scheduled. They have some unique options, including Rivalry Cups, where two tracks compete against each other to see who is the best, to simple local cup days.
