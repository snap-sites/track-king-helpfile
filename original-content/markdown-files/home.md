# Welcome TK Players! (Home Page)

Welcome all new (and maybe even some old!) players to Track King.

This site has been created to provide some basic information that I, as a newcomer to the game, have found very useful and handy.

A couple of things to remember first about the game, and about this site.

Track King is a very individual game, each person creates the stable as they want to. All information contained in this site does not make a winning stable! It is merely a guide to help you along the way to getting started in becoming a great TK!

The information provided here is a very basic guide to getting started. There is alot more to playing TK than what I have provided.

Enjoy the game, I hope this site helps you out, and hopefully we will see you at the winning line soon!

Good Luck!
