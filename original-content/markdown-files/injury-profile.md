# Injury Profile

The beginning of season six saw the introduction of a new change to TK - The Injury Profile (IP). The basic purpose of the injury profile was to stop people from over-racing and over-training horses, without experiencing any injury, which was considered an unrealistic approach, so the IP was born.

## What is it exactly?

The IP is culmulative build up of injury markers, or likely injury causing activites, which, over a period of time, gradually increase the risk of the horse having either increased frequency in light injuries, (bloody nose, slight knock, in some discomfort - refer to the trainers comments post race in the form guide to find this information out) or an increased risk of a major injury (need x-rays) or both.

The longer a horse is partaking in these behaviours without rest, the more likely these events are to occur.

## What causes IP?

Both training and racing effect the Injury Profile.

### Racing
In the case of racing, many things affect the likelihood of the horse being adversely affected by the IP:

- **Race Distance** - The first element to effect the IP is the distance of the race. The shorter the race, both the less time for the horse to physically sustain an injury, and also the less taxing on the horse physically.

- **Track Condition** - Track condition affects the effort with which it takes the horse to complete the race, and also the speed with which the horse will run. The heavier the track condition, the harder it is for the horse, the more tiring, and thus, the more likely to sustain an injury, or have an increased negative impact on the horses IP.

- **Stats** - the stats of your horse also help to determine both the speed with which they will run during a race, and also the stamina they have to maintain that speed over the distance, in the track condition. Higher stamina proportionate to the speed stats (gate speed & acceleration), race length and track condition will result in a lower physical toll on the horse from the race, therefore making a smaller impact on the IP

- **Jockey** - The jockey personality (passive vs aggressive) their traits (spares the horse vs won't spare the horse, eager to lead vs wants to place well etc etc) and also their apprentice/professional status all impact on how much the jockey will push the horse, and much they will get out of the horse, affecting the amount the horse puts into a race.
  - Aggressive + won't spare the horse + professional jockey = horse running harder/faster, therefore increasing the impact on IP

- **Race Instructions** - Variations in race instructions will affect how much effort the horse puts into the race. A horse on 'take it easy' x 4 will have a lower impact on IP than a horse with 'top speed' x 4. Remember though, the instructions are influenced by the jockey, and by the field of horses in the race, and the horse's position within the race - it may not be a foolproof way to reduce the risk of IP impact in a race where the horse is overmatched.

- **Competition** - The level of competition in a race (bot vs top rated vs same level) affects how much harder the horse & jockey will work together to win. A high level horse racing against bots is going to have a much easier race win, than a moderate to high level horse racing against horses at the same or higher levels. The tougher the competition, the more the horse will have to work to win/place, and the higher impact on IP.

### Training
Impacts on IP vary depending on several different things:

- **Type** - training such as swimming or cross country, which is very physically demanding on the horse, carries a much larger impact to the IP than a medium workout such as conditioning
- **Hours** - The more hours of training a horse recieves, the larger the impact it has on the IP.
- **Condition** - The medical, physical & vet assessment of the horse also impact on how much they will be affected by training. A horse that is tired from racing who is put on 12 hours of swimming, is at very high risk of having a negative impact on IP.

## So how do you prevent it?

The simple answer is - you can't prevent IP. IP is designed to add a degree of realism to the game, in the aim to prevent the horse from being overworked. If you train or race your horse, it will have an IP. The aim is to effectively manage the horses IP, to maximise both training and racing.

There is a few things that help the IP:

### Rest
The biggest cause of a build-up in a horses' IP is over racing. It's important to balance enough races to ensure the horse is still financially viable within the stable, without over racing and ending up with an injured horse. A complete rest, from both training and racing, of between 2 and 4 weeks will completely reset any built up IP. The severity of the IP will impact how long it takes to improve. A four week spell from active training and racing will ensure that any accumulated IP is completely resolved.

### Training
While 12 hours of swimming will have a major negative impact on the IP, training such as pampering will have a positive impact on your horses IP. This training can be used to help rejuvenate your horse, and reduce the IP. But remember – this training type is not necessarily effective in training a horse's stats, and can often cause a drop in them.

### Vet hours
If your horses medical condition drops away as the IP increases, then increasing the number of vet hours will help to reduce the physical injury on the horse, and hasten it's return to a vigorous medical status, but it has minimal impact on the IP itself, and will do little to reduce it, except as secondary to improving the medical condition of the horse, therefore increasing it's overall health & rate of recovery

### Specialist Facilities
A specialist facility such as the Expert Farrier, which provides an increase to daily medical and physical recovery can help to speed up the recovery from races and training, and thus decrease the IP in the process.

## What is Vet Assessment?

To help the stable managers identify the level of the horse's IP, the vet assessment tool was also introduced. It differs from the medical condition of the horse. It is a comprehensive assessment of the condition of the horse related to the IP, taking into account the medical condition, physical condition, recent race activity, recent training sessions and vet sessions. It can be used as a guide as to where you horse's IP is at, and whether or not the horse is ready to race.

## A few helpful hints to keeping your champion in prime condition:

- Aim to race no more than once a week, usually every 10-14 days is ideal, especially with horses of low stamina (This is just a guide, some horses will be able to race twice a week – but remember, the longer you do that, the higher your IP will get, even if you don't see it in the results/horse condition)
- Race selection – get the race right for your horse, and gauge your level of competition accurately.
- Jockey selection – consider your race distance, the track condition, your horses' stats and xp when choosing the best jockey.
- Set your race instructions with care
- Always run your horse in the best condition possible – vigorous medical, vigorous physical, vigorous medical assessment is the ideal.
- Plan races and training carefully to compliment each other – don't do 12 hours swimming, the same day as a 3200m race. If you intend on doing 12 hours swimming, consider resting the horse that week. And accordingly, if you do run in a 3200m race, consider a lighter training option, or less hours.
- If your horse is in poor condition – use pampering, rest and vet hours to bring the horse back.
- If your horse just isn't 100% on training day, and you think the IP might be high – either change your training to something easier (cross country to conditioning) or reduce the hours (eg. 10 down to 5)

Following these simple steps will help to manage the IP of your horses, and prevent you from ending up in the situation of having a stable full of injured horses who are going to take time to recover. If you do get stuck, and you aren't sure what to do with a horse – don't forget to ask in the forums!

## Auctions

Be aware when buying a horse from auction, that it may have a high IP. When you are looking at the horse, don't just make sure it has vigorous vet assessment. Consider the recent races – compare times over each quarter, was the horse slowing down? Has the horse drastically declined in race performance? Also look at recent training – have they had big sessions of heavy training?

Remember – IP is more than just vet assessment, you need to do your own assessment on where the horse is at, based on it's recent activities.

**Note:** *pampering is the exception to the rule, and is the only training to have a positive impact on Vet Assessment. Some other light training methods however, may have no impact.
