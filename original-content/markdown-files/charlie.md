# Charlie

Who is this crazy man you may ask?

Charlie is the interactive 'help' man, who helps you on your way to success. Charlie will introduce you to your stable, and take you on a guided tour, to help get you started with the basic care and maintainence.

Charlie is not a help guide, he is just a tour guide. He will help you to locate the main area's that you will initially need to find to get started. After that, it's all up to you!

You can, ofcourse, refer back to Charlie anytime you like, but, remember, he doesn't give advice or answer, and is just the tour guide, but a very good one, and if you get stuck, lost, or forget where to get help, Charlie will help you find your way again.
