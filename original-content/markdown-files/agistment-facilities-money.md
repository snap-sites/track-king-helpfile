# Agistment, Facilities and Money!

## Agistment

This is the term given to extra stalls that you buy, and with the help of your handy admin staff, which you will also have to purchase, they are leased out to the public. Each stable is allowed a maximum of 30 stalls. The number of these stalls that you can afford to buy and lease is entirely up to you. It is a good source of reliable steady income to add to that sponsorship!

Training hours can also be purchased (max. 60) and leased to the public in the same manner.

**Admin Staff** - once hired these staff do require a small weekly wage, but it is a very small percentage of the amount of income they bring into your stable.

## Facilities

On the training & vet page, you will also notice a [Specialist Facilities](http://www.trackking.org/facilities.php) section. There is many different types of facilities, and each one has a different bonus it adds to the stable. The prices vary, and the amount of money you put into them varies. Which facilities you choose depends entirely on you, and what you want.

### An important note

These facilities are **OPTIONAL** only. You can still run a very successful stable without them. It is also important to not underestimate the amount these facilities will take from your weekly cashflow. If you are only just breaking even - they are probably NOT a good idea.

## The Money Side

**Facilities** - cost money  
**Agistment** - provides money
