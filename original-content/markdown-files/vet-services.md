# Vet Services

## Overview

Vet services are applied to horses to help increase the rate of improvement in both their physical and medical condition. The more vet hours, the faster you can expect your horses to improve.

**But remember, vets have MINIMAL impact on physical recuperation. Time plays a much more important role than vets.**

## When Vet Services Are Needed

Racing and some types of training are hard work on your horse, and you can expect a drop in physical condition, and if the horse picks up an injury in a race, a drop in medical condition. This is when your team of expert vets step in, and work hard to get the horse fit and healthy again. 

Some training types (pampering) will also help improve your horses physical and medical condition, but remember, every training has its drawbacks!

## Vet Hours Limit

As with training, the maximum number of vet hours you can put on a horse is **12**.

## Costs and Billing

- Depending on class depends on how much the vet hours will cost you
- You will pay the cost of these hours each week, regardless of whether or not you use them
- Vet hours, unlike most other services, **do not have a cost for reducing them**

## Important Timing Note

It's important to note that if you wish to reduce your number of vet hours, the best time to do it is as close as possible to financial update on Sunday night, as this maximises the amount of time you get from the vets that you have already paid for, without incurring the cost of having them on staff for another week.
