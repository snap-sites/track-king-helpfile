## What is Prestige?

Prestige equates to your stable's overall 'score' in Track King, an indicator of the success you've had as a stable manager and sometimes gambler!

## How to Gain Prestige

You can gain prestige to a greater or lesser extent by:

- **Winning races**
- **Placing in races**
- **Promoting to next racing class** (or lose prestige by demoting!)
- **Participating/winning races away from your Local Track**
- **Being a successful gambler**

## Types of Prestige

Prestige comes in several forms on TK. Primarily, the prestige refers to the level your stable is at.
