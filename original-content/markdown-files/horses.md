# Horses

As you will have discovered, your stable comes ready-made with four horses. This is the minimum number of horses needed to maintain your stable, and it is also the number of maintainence free stalls that you have.

Each horse will come with the following traits and stats:

## Horse Traits

- **Spirit** - This refers to the temperament of the horse. Different temperaments influence the horse during racing, and also the rapport between the horse and jockey.

- **Height** - Quite simple - How tall the horse is. The shortest horse in TK is 15.0hh, the tallest 19.2hh (hh - hands heigh - the official measurement used for horses). There is much contention in TK even among the old and wise, over what height is best suited to what distance, and all my research tells me... No one really know, except perhaps Hairboy, and he isn't saying much!

- **Stride** - The amount of ground the horse covers with each step. This is effected by different types of training.

- **Medical Condition** - Self explanatory - The medical condition is improved by Vet Services. A medical condition other than 'vigorous' suggests that the horse is injured, or at high risk of being injured if raced/trained in that condition.

- **Physical Condition** - Self explanatory - Physical condition is affected by racing, and will drop a varying number of levels depending on different things - Jockey, horse stats, race distance, track condition. Vet time will help to increase the rate of improvement slightly, but the biggest improvement simply comes with time. Some training types can also improve or reduce both physical and medical condition.

- **Racing Style** - Some horses come with a racing style. These styles are a bit of a mysterious quality bestowed upon the lucky horse. Each style has both advantages and draw backs. If you have a styled horse, it is important that you try to discover what the drawbacks of this style are, and the advantages. Try finding a successful stable that has a horse with the same style, and ask them for some tips about it.

- **Vet Assessment** - This is different to the medical condition. It provides a guideline as the how the horse is doing overall. Linked to the Injury Profile (IP) it provides a guiding assessment of the horses overall condition. It takes into account fatigue and injury risk from racing and training. The worse the Vet Assessment, the higher their IP, making the horse at a much higher risk of injury, and of recurring injury.

*This image is what you should see when you look at your horses. The column on the left are traits of the horse, the column on the right the body stats. The graph on the bottom is an OC only feature, providing a pictorial guide to the horses stats.*

## Body Stats

Often referred to as 'top' (Gate Speed & Acceleration) and bottom (Muscle Tone, Stamina & Heart)

- **Gate Speed** - Refers to how fast the horse breaks from the starting stalls at the beginning of a race. It also helps to determine how quickly the horse will change direction and pace during a race.

- **Acceleration** - How fast can that horse go? Acceleration is simply how fast your horse can get up and go in a race.

- **Muscle Tone** - Arguably the most important stat (in my opinion) muscle tone is an important factor in determining how long the horse can maintain speed and stamina for.

- **Stamina** - the ability of the horse to 'stay' the distance of the race. An overall fitness marker.

- **Heart** - A magic quality revered in the racing world. Heart is a mysterious quality that makes a horse try that little bit harder, push that little bit harder, dig deeper than ever before to get past the winning post first.

## Experience (XP) Stats

These stats provide some assistance in choosing the most appropriate distance, and the most appropriate track condition to race your horse on, to help them get that winning result! You can still race horses at ALL distances, these stats simply give a better idea of which is the most suitable to the horse.

*When you look at your horse page, click the 'Experience and Form' tab, to see this information about the horse*

*In this diagram, you will notice that this horse is preferred distance is Long, and track condition is Dead. You will also see the small white arrows next to Epic & Dead. These indicate and increase in the xp in the last race.*

When you first start looking at your horses, you will notice that they all will have generally quite poor body stats, with very good XP stats. The high race XP is what will help those horses of yours earn you money until you start getting some training into them to improve their body stats.

## Overall Rating

This refers to a GUIDELINE of where your horse is at. The process of working out a horse's overall rating incorporates many different aspects of the horses stats. You will notice that when the horse has just raced, it will drop anywhere between 4 and 10 overall rating points. This is due to the physical effects of the race on the horse. This rating should NOT be used as anything other than a rough guideline as to where your horse is at.

## Schedule

Each horse has a Schedule. These schedules will show you when the horse next recieves vet services, when they next have training, if they are entered in a race or if they are travelling to of from another track. TAKE NOTE - occasionally when you take over a stable, your horse will be entered in a race that the previous BOT (computer managed) manager had entered the horse into. You do not need run the horse in that race. You can scratch it if you do not want to run it.

## Season Calendar

On your stable home page, you will also find a diagramatic season calendar, on which the vet, training and racing schedules for all horses will be listed. For OC members, it will show a more detailed list of events, and also will allow you to create your own reminders/events as well!
