# Mentor Program

So you've decided to join the ever expanding Track King community. That's great! Welcome aboard!

But I hear you ask....where to from here? What do I do? How do I do it?

Fear not fellow stable owner, for help is readily at hand!

The Track King Mentor Program is designed for players just like yourself who want to jump right in and start playing, but are wondering about the finer points of the game.

By joining the Program you will be assigned a veteran player (your mentor) who will be happy to advise and guide you during the first few weeks of Track King. They won't run your stables for you, but they are more than happy to give you the tools and knowledge to help you help yourself, at the same time avoiding the pitfalls that can hinder many a newbie.

Feel free to ask them any questions you may have about the game, believe me there is no such thing as a stupid question!
