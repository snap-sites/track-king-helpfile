# What comes next?

So you have followed the steps, you are a month or so down the road, you have taken the TK world by storm, and are winning races left and right. Well, we can dream anyway!

So now you are wondering about all these other aspects of TK that you have been dying to try out, and want to know more about. You have the training sussed, you have been competing weekly in your class races, and your horses are improving steadily (we hope!)

You are now ready for the next TK challenge!
