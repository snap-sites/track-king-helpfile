# Training

The theories on training are endless. Everyone has a different opinion on each different type, on the number of hours, and on the uses for different things, and what are the best balances for different racing distances and styles.

## Basic Training Notes

- You are allowed a maximum of 12 hours training for each horse
- Each training type targets different aspects
- There is a upside and a downside to each type of training. Some are obvious, some are common knowledge, and some are all a bit vague.
- Some training will effect the physical condition of your horse - some are more tiring than others.
- Changes in horses' stats are indicated in blue for increases, and red for decreases
- It is a reasonably well agreed upon consensus that as a horse gets older the less training that SHOULD be required.
- Horses running in longer races will need higher muscle tone, stamina and heart (bottom stats).
- Horses running in shorter races will need higher gate speed and acceleration.
- Horses at all distances need at least some training on all stats.

## Training Hour Guidelines

As a rough starting guide, begin with what hours you can afford:
- 3 to 5 hours on older horses
- 4 to 6 on middle age horses  
- 6 to 10 on youngsters

These are only GUIDE numbers of hours to use. Some people would argue more, some people would argue less. It is up to you to find an amount that you can A - afford the upkeep of, and B - can get effective results with.

The cost of training hours depends on you class, and there is a weekly upkeep cost for them as well.

## Beginner 3-Week Training Plan

As a beginning guideline to starting your training, here is a three week training plan to help get you started. This plan should by no means be followed religiously, nor must you use it. It is simply a starting point for those who wish to use it, and will provide a nice balanced improvement on the stats of your horses.

### Sprint/Short:
- Wk 1: Short Sprints (3 hr session)
- Wk 2: Starting Stalls (3 hr session)  
- Wk 3: Beach Gallops (3 hr session)

### Middle/Long/Epic:
*(not likely that you will have an epic as a starting horse)*
- Wk 1: Cross Country (3 hr session)
- Wk 2: Short Sprints (3 hr session)
- Wk 3: Beach Gallops (3 hr session)

## Training Types

The table below contains all the training types available in TK. It contains the rises (blue plus) and drops (red minus) of each training type. It should hopefully provide you with a guide of what training will increase/decrease which stats, hopefully helping you manage your horses improvement!

*This training types may not be 100% accurate, and should only be used as a guide.*

**Color Coding:**
- **Green:** These represent training types that are primarily used for the improvement of body stats
- **Pink:** These training types are primarily for the improvement of distance xp, though they also have impacts on body stats  
- **Blue:** Indicates medical and physical changes as a result of certain training types
- **Yellow:** Indicates the changes to weight and stride
