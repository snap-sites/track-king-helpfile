# Yearling Sales

## Overview

Yearling sales, or a yearling pull as they are commonly referred to are open to anyone who wishes to buy a two year old horse, and can be accessed once a week.

## What You Need to Remember When Purchasing

- **You are buying without knowing what you are getting**
- You may OCCASIONALLY get a styled horse
- **In general, these horse WON'T be in good condition, won't have good stats, and won't have good XP**
- You can choose how much you spend on the yearling - the more you spend the better your CHANCE of getting a good horse, **it is no guaranteed thing**
- **A yearling will have poor genetics compared to a horse that has been purposely bred by someone**

## So Why Buy a Yearling?

Well, I'm not really sure!!! Personally, I buy yearlings to trial different training methods, or in the hope that I get a good one (I have yet to have this happen)

You have a better chance of getting a decent 2 year old at the auctions, especially at the beginning of a season when stables who breed are selling their poorer stock - pay attention, **styled horses can go very cheap this time of year!**

## Important Timing and Considerations

- **Remember** - if you are buying a yearling, it is better to buy at the beginning of the season, so you have the entire season to train the horse up before it ages!
- **Don't Forget** - your new yearling will require a **STALL** once it is purchased. If you do not have enough stalls available, all your horses will suffer.
