# Breeding

Breeding your own champion of the next generation can be quite a challenge, and quite exciting. Breeding is a hotly contested subject, especially around week 10 of the season, as everyone is most active breeding now, in the aim to get a week one foal.

What the rights and wrongs to breeding are is still a bit of a mystery. Some say they have it all figured out, others say they just thrown them together and see what happens.

## A few known facts:

- Horse XP DOES NOT impact on the foal
- Some horses are dominant, and their traits will carry through to the foal, good and BAD!
- Stats, height, temperament, and style of the parent all impact on what your new foal will be born with.
- Medical & Physical Condition - many differing opinions on this one!
  - Some people believe the mare needs to be vig/vig
  - Some people believe the stallion needs to be vig/vig
  - Others believe neither have to be.
  - Others believe both should be.
  - Personally, I think the better the condition of both horses, the better and faster your foal will grow
- Week 1 - most people will breed to have a week 1 of the new season foal - this gives you a better chance of being competitive with your new addition at a younger age, as you will have more time for training before the horse ages. HOWEVER, it is not foolproof, and there are plenty of good late season foals around!
- Genetics play an important part in what your foal will turn out like (for more information, see Genetics - this link will navigate you away from this page)

## So what happens once you select your matched pairs?

- Once a horse is 4 years old, it is eligible to enter the realm of parenthood.
- Mares CANNOT race once in foal
- Both mare & stallion will experience a medical and or physical condition drop after breeding
- Mares will train at a slower pace while pregnant - generally people don't train pregnant mares for this reason
- On Birthing day, it is important to have some vet hours handy for the mare, as it will take alot out of her!
- It is important to allocate some hours to that new foal as well, as they will also be tired after the birth (can't be done until the foal is born)
- Gestation period on TK is between 3-4 weeks.
- Foals are born on Fridays and are 2 years old at time of birth, and eligible to start racing straight away! (you may want to give them some vet and training time first though...)
- Foals belong to the stable who owns the mare AT THE TIME OF BIRTH - be wary both buying and selling mares in foal for due dates vs auction end times.
- A foal is only considered 'Homebred' if the mare was the property of your stable and you organised the breeding (the stud does not have to be from your stable, and can be an auction purchase)

## How to see your foal immediately after breeding:

- Click on the expectant mum-to-be and go to her page
- Click on Horse History
- Click on Foals tab
- Click on -unborn foal-
- This will show you the colour, gender, lineage and foetal rating of your future champion!
- For OC members - you can also explore the family tree of your foal, and explore your foals relations!

**Remember** - your new foal will require a STALL once it is born. If you do not have enough stalls available, all you horses will suffer.

## The Complete Guide To Breeding - The Real Cost
*By Cerberus of The Dog Food Factory*

All costs are based around a class 1 stable and all overall ratings are considered at vig vig. Before you go having your horses breed, you need to consider exactly how much this is going to cost you cashwise...and what will you do if the breeding was "unsucessful".

### Basic Costs

The gestation time we will average out as 3 full weeks for arguements sake.

- The average cost to house 1 horse is $15000 per week just for filling the stall and not leasing it out.
- Each hour of vet time is $6,488 per week only using 1 hour on a horse.
- Total cost just in maintenance fees = $21,488 per week...$27,976 if you run 2 hrs of vets.

### Racing Income Lost

The mare needs to be at vig/vig for conception...that means no racing the week before conception and the week after birthing, plus the 3 weeks gestation. I'll only average a mare generating $30,000 per race in purses that it misses and I'll only assume the mare races every 2 weeks to keep it on the down side.

1 week before + 3 weeks gestation + 1 week recovery = 2 races could have been run in that time with you missing out on $60000+ in purses.

### Total Investment Calculation

- Total investment for this horse 5 weeks of filled stall and vets at only 1 hr = $107,440
- 2 missed purses = $60,000
- **Total cost to your stable to breed 1 horse in class 1 with only 1 hour of vets = $167,440**

*If your horse usually raced every week add another $180,000 in missed purses.*

Clearly if your horse is unstyled you have paid almost a small fortune for something you could have bought right away from the auctions at $20,000

### When To Breed

Ideally you want to do all your breeding to have a week 1 foal...thats means the birthdate of this horse needs to be the first friday in the new season. There will always be posts on when the exact date is to get a week 1 foal in the forums.

### The Pair Up

The key to good breeding is to try and get styled horses to breed through their racing style to the foal...unstyled horses are good yes but arent worth anything on the market these days.

You need to look at the breeding histroy of both horses:

- If the stallion has a style and has been passing it onto his foals he is **dominant**
- If the mare has been serviced by dominant stallions who usually pass on their trait but with her they dont and her style comes through she is **dominant**.
- If both are dominant its a big dice roll as to who is more dominant and they both might even miss out all together.
- If the mare has been serviced by a few stallions and their style seems to come through often she is **submissive** and chances are that your stallions style will pass onto her if he has done it before. This is the type of mare you want to breed with.

### Mare And Foetal Health

The mare needs to be **vig/vig NO EXCEPTIONS**...heres why:

If the mare is vig/vig and is serviced she will usually drop around 2 physical and rarely one medical...so she should be around vig/adq or fresh/adq afterwards.

If you race your mare and then service her, say she is Vig/Drained and after servicing she becomes Vig/wasted or vig/incapacitated, the time it will take your mare to get back to vig/vig is going to be wayyyy longer.

#### 2 things to remember about breeding:

1. The unborn foal starts off at around 2-5 overall rating points and in the first week if the mare is healthy will pop 2 points per day...the most growth a foal gets is in the first week
2. The foetal growth rate is tied to the overall condition of the mare carrying it

So you see its not the fact that the mares condition wasnt great when she actually concieved that hurts the foal (that is irrelevant)...its the time it takes to get back to vig/vig where the slow development takes hold thats important.

### Final Considerations

Remember Every horse you breed costs you around $167,440...plus another $15,000 per week to house this new foal...plus vets...and then of course the training.

If you are going to breed think long and hard about why you are breeding and can you just buy what you want on the market ready to go for 1/5th of the price.

*Remember these costs are just a guide, and the figures may not be accurate depending on your class and prestige level.*
