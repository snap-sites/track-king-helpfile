# Auctions

## ⚠️ Warning: Beware the Auctions!

**Beware the auctions, for they are an addictive place!**

In your first weeks, you will notice you have a large amount of money, and will be very tempted to buy horses on the auction market with it!

## **DON'T!**

Until you are aware of what constitutes a good or bad horse, and until you are sure what you specifically are looking for in a horse, **DON'T BUY ONE!**

## Market Timing and Strategy

It is important to remember when buying that different times of the season have different popularity:

- **End of season**: Prices may go up as people have received their end of season bonus money
- **Beginning of season**: You will find a lot of cheap, week 1 foals flooding the market

### Research Before Buying

- Monitor the markets for a week or so before you start looking for a horse to buy
- Get an idea of what is available, and how much it is selling for
- If you are unsure of whether or not a horse is good value, a good horse or worth buying, you can always post a link in the **Help me Please forum**, and get some advice from more experienced players

## Key Rules

### The Most Important Rule
**DO NOT over extend yourself to purchase a horse.**

### Auction Basics
Other than that, there isn't a whole lot to say about auctions - once you have found a horse you like, watch it, bid on it, and hopefully you will get it.

## Important Notes

- **Horses can still be raced by the current owner while being auctioned!**
- **Remember - your new horse will require a STALL once it is purchased.** If you do not have enough stalls available, all your horses will suffer.
