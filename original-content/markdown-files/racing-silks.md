# All The Pretty Pictures (Racing Silks)

## Stable Silks

The beginning of season six saw the introduction of a much larger range of options for the more artistically gifted players when it came to creating fabulous silks to show off to the world during races. I've included some examples taken (without permission, oops! but I'm sure they won't mind!) from various stables within the TK community, as some examples of what can be done with the new silks creator!

### Racing Silk Examples

*Note: This page originally contained multiple visual examples of racing silks created by various stables in the TK community. The silks showcase different patterns, colors, and designs available through the silks creator.*

## Stable Logo

You can upload any image you like, either something of your own creation specifically for your stable, or a picture or logo of your choice. Here is a couple of examples of stable specific logo's that some players have created.

### Getting Help with Logos

If you are a bit like me, and aren't particularly handy with creating pictures to use as logos, there is several people on TK who are willing to help out, so just try putting a post in the forums, and see who responds.

### Logo Examples

*Note: This page originally contained several examples of custom stable logos created by players, demonstrating the variety and creativity possible with custom stable branding.*

## Visual Elements Note

This page was heavily visual in nature, containing numerous examples of:
- Racing silk patterns and color combinations
- Custom stable logos and branding
- Examples of creative designs from the TK community

The archived version contains image links to external hosts (Photobucket) and internal Google Sites images that showcase the visual customization options available to players.
